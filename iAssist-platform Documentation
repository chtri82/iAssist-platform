# iAssist Platform
Cloud-ready, modular AI + Data Infrastructure built with Docker, .NET, Python, and R — designed for data science pipelines, machine learning workflows, and orchestration with Airflow and Databricks.

## ⚙️ Running iAssist Platform
The platform provides a full local orchestration environment with isolated microservices and self-healing management through the bash manager script.

| Command | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `./iAssist_manager.sh start` | Start all services + health checks |
| `./iAssist_manager.sh start --logs` | Start + stream logs live |
| `./iAssist_manager.sh stop` | Stop all services |
| `./iAssist_manager.sh rebuild` | Full rebuild (fresh containers) |
| `./iAssist_manager.sh status` | Show running container info |
| `./iAssist_manager.sh clean --force` | Remove all containers, volumes, networks |

## 🧱 Core Modular Architecture
iAssist Platform
.NET API Gateway
PostgreSQL DB

## 🐳 Containerized Microservice Deployment
API Gateway (8080) -> AI Core (5000) -> R Analytics (8000) ->  PostgreSQL (5432)

Each service runs in an isolated container connected through the `iassist-net` Docker network.

## 📊 Data and AI Pipeline Flow
API Gateway (.NET) -> AI Core (FastAPI + Python) -> R Analytics (Plumber + R) -> PostgreSQL Database

## ☁️ Cloud / Databricks Integration
Data flows through Databricks for cleaning, feature engineering, and model lifecycle management with MLflow.

## 🧩 Future Extensions
- Prefect-based dynamic orchestration
- AutoML integrations (Databricks / H2O / Vertex AI)
- Fine-tuned LLM microservice bridge
